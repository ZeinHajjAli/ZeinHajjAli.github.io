      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few life events in the past few months, that will shape the way my future looks. That&amp;rsquo;s without counting the global pandemic happening around the world right now.
Academia After graduating from my undergraduate program, I recieved an acceptance to Carleton Universities M.Asc program in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I will be starting my masters degree in the fall of 2020 and will be supervised by Professor James Green.</description>

      <title>RIDD #1: FiveThirtyEight - The Riddler - “Dakota Jones”</title>
      <link>https://zeinhajjali.com/projects/ridd1/</link>

      <description>The statistics website FiveThirtyEight publishes weekly math and/or programming challenges in their &amp;lsquo;Culture&amp;rsquo; section every week under the title of &amp;lsquo;The Riddler&amp;rsquo;. I have started trying to solve these problems week by week as they come out. The Riddler for the week of September 13th, 2019 was called &amp;ldquo;Can You Help Dakota Jones Raid The Lost Ark?&amp;quot;. Each Riddler challenge come in two parts, the first is the Express, which is a shorter challenge that can usually be solved by hand, the second is the Classic which is usually a little tougher and might need some programming or scripting to solve.</description>

      <description>The Northern Nomad Systems Integration (NNSI) project has ended, and the final report has been submitted to the supervising professor and second reader. The project did not warrant a Github page. Instead, I have made the final report available for reading here, or for download here.
Any questions about the project can be directed to me at zeinhajjali@outlook.com.

      <description>The Gyroscope Self-Balancing Robot (GSBR) project has ended. Previous posts on the progress and results can be found on this site. A more detailed and better edited look at the project can be found in the final report that the team has written up here or as a download here. The source code and testing code can all be found at the Github page here.</description>

      <title>NNSI #2: Final Update &amp; Conclusion</title>

      <description>The Northern Nomad Systems Integration project has ended, and the final report is close to finished. The team ran into a lot of setbacks, but that is to be expected from a real world project. Our main issue was that we were not given any documentation or compiled information about all the systems that are installed in the house. We decided to make our final report as comprehensive as possible and available to any future teams that will work on the Nomad.</description>

      <description>Two months have passed since my last update on the Gyroscope Self-Balancing Robot and a lot has happened. The team wrote up a progress report, we built the self-balancing code framework, and did a whole lot of testing to get the correct PID constant values to keep the robot upright without oscillating too heavily. The demo went smoothly, and we have some videos of the robot keeping upright at different PID values.</description>

      <title>GSBR #2: Components and Splitting Tasks</title>

      <description>Last Friday the team met in the project lab to talk about next steps and move forward. The Github page wasn&amp;rsquo;t set up when I wrote the first post, but it can be found here.
 Theo and Emmanuel started work on the platform we need to build. The platform/base given to us works fine for a rover style robot, but is not very suited for a self-balancing robot. We decided on a two or three platform base, keeping the battery pack on the highest level since it is the heaviest.</description>

      <description>Since I have done most of the post already in the project proposal for this project, I have re-written it here instead of re-doing all the work again. This proposal was in collaberation with the team memebers mentioned below.
 SYSC 4805 - Computer Systems Design Lab Project Proposal Group #9 Students: Theo Hronowsky	101008637
Emmanuel Oluyomi	100953361
Zein Hajj-Ali	101020677
Hussain Aljabri	100935515
Ahmad Ayyoub	100954214
Objectives The goal of the computer systems design lab as part of the SYSC 4805 project is to design and implement a robotic platform.</description>

      <title>SITE #2: Fixed the Domain Issue</title>
      <link>https://zeinhajjali.com/projects/site2/</link>

      <description>As it turns out, the HTTPS issue was because I was using Dynadot as my registrar since they apparently don’t support LetsEncrypt. After switching to NameSilo.com the issue went away, and every request came back with certificate by LetsEncrypt.
As for the CSS not loading after switching my Github site repository to redirect to the custom domain and setting the DNS settings correctly (as outlined on the Github Pages help site), I found that I had kept my base domain in my ‘config.</description>
