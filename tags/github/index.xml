      <description>Starting in the Fall semester of 2019, I will be taking a course at Carleton University on machine learning. The course description revealed that we will be working through &amp;lsquo;The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book&amp;rsquo; by Andriy Burkov. Seeing this, I decided to get a head start and go through as much of the book as I can on my own. I feel like this will be a great opportunity to learn about and implement a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been very interested in since I heard about it.</description>
