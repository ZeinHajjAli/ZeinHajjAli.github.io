      <description>I am not artistic. It took me my whole life to accept it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally figured it out. Throughout my life I&amp;rsquo;ve taken up countless &amp;ldquo;hobbies&amp;rdquo;, some of which are artistic, while others are technical. During the past week, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that the reason I take up so many hobbies and never stick to them is that I like to learn the conceptual and unchanging aspects of them, then move on to something different.</description>
