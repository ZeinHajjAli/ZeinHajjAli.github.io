      <description>The statistics website FiveThirtyEight publishes weekly math and/or programming challenges in their &amp;lsquo;Culture&amp;rsquo; section every week under the title of &amp;lsquo;The Riddler&amp;rsquo;. I have started trying to solve these problems week by week as they come out. The Riddler for the week of September 13th, 2019 was called &amp;ldquo;Can You Help Dakota Jones Raid The Lost Ark?&amp;quot;. Each Riddler challenge come in two parts, the first is the Express, which is a shorter challenge that can usually be solved by hand, the second is the Classic which is usually a little tougher and might need some programming or scripting to solve.</description>
