      <description>The Northern Nomad Systems Integration project has ended, and the final report is close to finished. The team ran into a lot of setbacks, but that is to be expected from a real world project. Our main issue was that we were not given any documentation or compiled information about all the systems that are installed in the house. We decided to make our final report as comprehensive as possible and available to any future teams that will work on the Nomad.</description>

      <description>Today I received my order of an Arduino Uno R3 kit. I’ve got a few ideas of some projects to work on. Some of these I haven’t found anything already online for. Might be a chance to build something that hasn’t been done in the same way before:
 Arduino film camera (homemade shutter and all). Robotic arm built from scrap around the house. A printer that really works (no, like really works).</description>

      <description>Introduction Starting September of 2018, I joined a project as my capstone engineering project at Carleton University. The project was led by Professor Donald Bailey and included 5 other team members as well as myself. The Northern Nomad Tiny House&amp;rsquo;s goals included independence from the internet, net-zero emissions, and net-zero water usage. The project was to integrate and develop the system used in the Northern Nomad Tiny House that was built on campus.</description>
