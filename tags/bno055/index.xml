      <description>Last Friday the team met in the project lab to talk about next steps and move forward. The Github page wasn&amp;rsquo;t set up when I wrote the first post, but it can be found here.
Theo and Emmanuel started work on the platform we need to build. The platform/base given to us works fine for a rover style robot, but is not very suited for a self-balancing robot. We decided on a two or three platform base, keeping the battery pack on the highest level since it is the heaviest.</description>
