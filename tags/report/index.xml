      <description>The Northern Nomad Systems Integration (NNSI) project has ended, and the final report has been submitted to the supervising professor and second reader. The project did not warrant a Github page. Instead, I have made the final report available for reading here, or for download here.
Any questions about the project can be directed to me at zeinhajjali@outlook.com.
