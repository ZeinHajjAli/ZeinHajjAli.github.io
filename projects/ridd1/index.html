		<h1>RIDD #1: FiveThirtyEight - The Riddler - “Dakota Jones”</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The statistics website FiveThirtyEight publishes weekly math and/or programming challenges in their &lsquo;Culture&rsquo; section every week under the title of &lsquo;The Riddler&rsquo;. I have started trying to solve these problems week by week as they come out. The Riddler for the week of September 13th, 2019 was called &ldquo;Can You Help Dakota Jones Raid The Lost Ark?&quot;. Each Riddler challenge come in two parts, the first is the Express, which is a shorter challenge that can usually be solved by hand, the second is the Classic which is usually a little tougher and might need some programming or scripting to solve.</p>
<p>My first try at solving an older Riddler challenge was the Classic challenge of the week of May 19th, 2019. That solution can be found <a href="https://zeinhajjali.com/RiddlerSolutions/BeatTheNightKing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-help-dakota-jones-raid-the-lost-arc/">Riddler Classic</a> for the week of September 13th, 2019 is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge is to find the longest string of letters in which (1) every pair of consecutive letters is a two-letter state or territory abbreviation, and (2) no state abbreviation occurs more than once. For example, Guam, Utah and Texas can be combined into the valid four-letter string GUTX. Another valid string is ALAK (Alabama, Louisiana and Alaska), while ALAL (Alabama, Louisiana and Alabama) is invalid because it includes the same state, Alabama, twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My solution to this challenge can be found <a href="https://zeinhajjali.com/RiddlerSolutions/DakotaJones/classic">here</a>.</p>
